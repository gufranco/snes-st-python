"""A microcode image its owner supplies, identified before it is run.

This layer lived in the processor package until that package decided a module
somebody soldered onto a board is the board's business rather than the
processor's. It was right, and this is the board, so the layer moved here whole
rather than being reinvented: the manifest, the diagnosis and the loader are the
same ones, with the parts that are Nintendo's named in the repository that models
Nintendo's parts.

The processor is complete without any of this. Every instruction it has is settled
by generating instruction words, and none of that needs a program anybody wrote.
An image is only needed to run one particular cartridge's part, and that image
belongs to whoever wrote it, so it is never carried here and never will be.

What is carried is the manifest: what each image is, how long it is, and the digest
that decides whether the copy on your disk is the one it claims to be. A digest
identifies a file and reconstructs nothing, which is the difference between saying
what something is and handing it over.

A file that does not match is diagnosed rather than merely refused. Being told that
a digest failed leaves you no wiser; being told the file is the right length with
different content, or the other revision, or an archive rather than the thing
inside it, tells you what to do next.
