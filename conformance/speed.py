"""How fast the part runs its microcode, and a floor it must not fall through.

Not a benchmark for its own sake. Every question this repository answers is
answered by stepping the processor, and replaying the exchanges read out of
thirty six cartridges steps it millions of times. The way that stops being usable
is gradual: a lookup grows an allocation, an offset becomes a comprehension, and
a year later a run nobody changed takes an hour. A floor that fails loudly is
cheaper than noticing.

The floor is deliberately far below what the chip does today. It is there to
catch something several times slower, not to police the noise between one runner
and another, because a shared runner's variance is larger than any change worth
arguing about.

Every figure is a median across repeats rather than a mean, because one
scheduling hiccup moves a mean and moves a median much less, and the runtime
version is printed beside it because it is the single thing that changes these
numbers most.

Run it outside the coverage step. A tracer costs about ten times what this does,
so a floor measured under one measures the tracer.
