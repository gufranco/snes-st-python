"""Fetch the reference implementation and build the driver that wraps it.

The reference implementations are a separate work under their own licence, so
they are fetched rather than carried here. Only the driver in `ref/` belongs to
this repository, and it is the only file that is compiled from this side.

The sources are pinned by commit. A build that resolves whatever upstream holds
today is not reproducible, and a change made upstream would turn this repository
red with no commit of its own to explain it.
